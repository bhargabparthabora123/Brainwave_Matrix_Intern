Made a relational database on mySql about library management system
I have made multiples tables such as books,authors,members and loans for the information storage regarding corresponding details.
Then two special tables have been made using composite primary key .The composite primary key is generally used to create a join table to find relations between two or multiple entities of a database.
the join tables are BookAuthors and BookCategories table.the implementation of the aforesaid concepts can be clearly seen inthe sql code snippet.
